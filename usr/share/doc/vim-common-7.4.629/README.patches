Patches for Vim - Vi IMproved 7.4

The files in this directory contain source code changes to fix problems
in a released version of Vim.  Each file also contains an explanation of
the problem that is fixed, like the message that was sent to the vim-dev
maillist.

The best is to apply the patches in sequence.  This avoids problems when
a patch depends on a previous patch. 

Before patching, change to the top Vim directory, where the "src" and
"runtime" directories are located.
Depending on the version of "patch" that you use, you may have add an
argument to make it patch the right file:
        patch -p < 7.4.001
        patch -p0 < 7.4.001

After applying a patch, you need to compile Vim.  There are no patches
for binaries.

Checksums for the patch files can be found in the file MD5.
